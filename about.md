Hello :) My name is Pedram and this is my personal blog. I use this corner of the internet to jot down my thoughts, articulate my views on topics that interest me and document my journey through the space of ideas.

While most of the content here will be technical notes and posts ([a](/posts/evolution-of-hardware-for-deep-learning) [couple](/posts/Recurrent-Neural-Networks) [favorites](/posts/serving-tf-on-cpu)), I try to reserve some room to explore my understanding of the more nebulous aspects of humanity and life. A few such essays that could most use some feedback: [principles](/thoughts/principles), [sacrifice](/posts/on-sacrifice), [maturity](/thoughts/maturity) and [personality](/thoughts/personality).

I currently work at Google Brain on systems for machine learning, researching and building [large-scale](http://stevenwhang.com/tfx_paper.pdf), [open-source](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx) software systems that allow others to design and build [software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35). More specifically, I have spent the past couple years building and scaling Google's next generation machine learning platform used by teams across Search, Maps, YouTube, Ads, etc. 

Outside of my work, I spend most of my time thinking about the following:

* [People](/tags/humans): The reasons behind why people act the way they do

* [Technology](/tags/technology): The top k most impactful technologies, and how they will evolve alongside humanity

* [Product](/tags/product): The bridge between people and technology, problems and solutions, ...

* [Math](/tags/math): The beautiful land of the abstract, far far away from the nasty idiosyncrasies of nature 

* [Machine Learning](/tags/ml): Thoughts on the science behind and practice of building learning systems

* [Music](/tags/music): The only constant in my life since I was 4 years old, a never-ending source of happiness

This blog has three types of content: [Media](/media), [Posts](/) and [Thoughts](/thoughts). Media and Posts are finished works that I feel comfortable sharing with the world. However, I view Thoughts as a playground where I can experiment with half-baked ideas. Unfortunately, I was not blessed with an [abnormally powerful brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) and so it often takes me weeks to months to fully develop an idea into something that can stand on its own. I view writing a Thought as planting a seed, whereby I force myself to serialize some portion of an idea, hoping that over time, I can nurture it, develop it and graduate to a Post or scratch it but hopefully learn something from it.

Since beginning of 2019, [peddy.ai](http://peddy.ai) has been my home on the internet. In addition to this blog ([blog.peddy.ai](http://blog.peddy.ai)), it mirrors my private git server ([git.peddy.ai](http://git.peddy.ai)), exposes my private Kubernetes cluster's API Server ([k8s.peddy.ai](http://k8s.peddy.ai)), hosts my public and private datasets ([data.peddy.ai](http://data.peddy.ai)), is a gateway to my home LAN ([home.peddy.ai](http://home.peddy.ai)), and more. 

Unsurprisingly, most neighborhoods within this domain are restricted and [should be] unreachable without proper credentials. While not a security expert by any means, I've spent a great deal of time designing the security posture of this tiny part of the interwebs that I control. If you're interested in network security (and a nice person :)), please feel free to snoop around and let me know if I have left any backdoors open.


If any of the content on this site interests you, please feel free to [reach out](/contact/) to me - I have many thoughts and far too few people to share them with :)
