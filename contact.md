I tend to spend most of my free time by myself. While this is conducive to being extremely productive and self-reflective, it also has the side-effect of alienating me from the rest of society. When I spend significant periods of time thinking about something in isolation (except reviewing literature on the topic), I allow myself to develop priors that are so different than those held by majority of others that communication and exchange of ideas (which I view as the [supreme end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_Stops)) become futile. Therefore, I probably need exposure to other humans and ideologies much more than I actively seek it.

If any of the content on this blog resonates with you, please feel free to reach out to me. Although it may take me a bit of time to get back to you, I will almost always respond to emails that are directed to me and are somewhat well thought out.

I'm not particularly active on Twitter, but it has led me to find some fascinating people.

I'm a huge proponent of open source software and try to do most of my development work in the open.
